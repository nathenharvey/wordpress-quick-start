Description
===========

Installs haproxy and prepares the configuration location.

Requirements
============

## Platform

* Ubuntu (10.04+ due to config option change)
* Debian (6.0+)

Attributes
==========

* `node['haproxy']['incoming_address']` - sets the address to bind the
  haproxy process on, 0.0.0.0 (all addresses) by default
* `node['haproxy']['incoming_port']` - sets the port on which haproxy
  listens
* `node['haproxy']['member_port']` - the port that member systems will
  be listening on, default 80
* `node['haproxy']['app_server_role']` - used by the `app_lb` recipe
  to search for a specific role of member systems. Default
  `webserver`.
* `node['haproxy']['balance_algorithm']` - sets the load balancing
  algorithm; defaults to roundrobin.
* `node['haproxy']['enable_ssl']` - whether or not to create listeners
  for ssl, default false
* `node['haproxy']['ssl_incoming_address']` - sets the address to bind
  the haproxy on for SSL, 0.0.0.0 (all addresses) by default
* `node['haproxy']['ssl_member_port']` - the port that member systems
  will be listening on for ssl, default 8443
* `node['haproxy']['ssl_incoming_port']` - sets the port on which
  haproxy listens for ssl, default 443
* `node['haproxy']['httpchk']` - used by the `app_lb` recipe. If set,
  will configure httpchk in haproxy.conf
* `node['haproxy']['ssl_httpchk']` - used by the `app_lb` recipe. If
  set and `enable_ssl` is true, will configure httpchk in haproxy.conf
  for the `ssl_applicaiton` section
* `node['haproxy']['enable_admin']` - whether to enable the admin
  interface. default true. Listens on port 22002.
* `node['haproxy']['admin']['address_bind']` - sets the address to
  bind the administrative interface on, 127.0.0.1 by default
* `node['haproxy']['admin']['port']` - sets the port for the
  administrative interface, 22002 by default
* `node['haproxy']['pid_file']` - the PID file of the haproxy process,
  used in the tuning recipe.
* `node['haproxy']['defaults_options']` - an array of options to use
  for the config file's `defaults` stanza, default is
  ["httplog", "dontlognull", "redispatch"]
* `node['haproxy']['defaults_timeouts']['connect']` - connect timeout
  in defaults stanza
* `node['haproxy']['defaults_timeouts']['client']` - client timeout in
  defaults stanza
* `node['haproxy']['defaults_timeouts']['server']` - server timeout in
  defaults stanza
* `node['haproxy']['x_forwarded_for']` - if true, creates an
  X-Forwarded-For header containing the original client's IP address.
  This option disables KeepAlive.
* `node['haproxy']['member_max_connections']` - the maxconn value to
  be set for each app server
* `node['haproxy']['user']` - user that haproxy runs as
* `node['haproxy']['group']` - group that haproxy runs as
* `node['haproxy']['global_max_connections']` - in the `app_lb`
  config, set the global maxconn
* `node['haproxy']['member_max_connections']` - in both configs, set
  the maxconn per member
* `node['haproxy']['frontend_max_connections']` - in the `app_lb`
  config, set the the maxconn per frontend member
* `node['haproxy']['frontend_ssl_max_connections']` - in the `app_lb`
  config, set the maxconn per frontend member using SSL

Recipes
=======

## default

Sets up haproxy using statically defined configuration. To override
the configuration, modify the templates/default/haproxy.cfg.erb file
directly, or supply your own and override the cookbook and source by
reopening the `template[/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg]` resource.

## app\_lb

Sets up haproxy using dynamically defined configuration through
search. See __Usage__ below.

## tuning

Uses the community `cpu` cookbook's `cpu_affinity` LWRP to set
affinity for the haproxy process.

Usage
=====

Use either the default recipe or the `app_lb` recipe.

When using the default recipe, modify the haproxy.cfg.erb file with
listener(s) for your sites/servers.

The `app_lb` recipe is designed to be used with the application
cookbook, and provides search mechanism to find the appropriate
application servers. Set this in a role that includes the
haproxy::app_lb recipe. For example,

    name "load_balancer"
    description "haproxy load balancer"
    run_list("recipe[haproxy::app_lb]")
    override_attributes(
      "haproxy" => {
        "app_server_role" => "webserver"
      }
    )

The search uses the node's `chef_environment`. For example, create
`environments/production.rb`, then upload it to the server with knife

    % cat environments/production.rb
    name "production"
    description "Nodes in the production environment."
    % knife environment from file production.rb
